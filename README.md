hoarderCache-docker
===================

This is my pre-configured docker container for running apt-cacher-ng. It's not
much, but it comes with a few things that may be of interest. In particular, it
pre-configures some repositories, some pre-caching, and setting offline mode
for now. It also exposes an import volume for other containers, that can be used
to trigger an import of the packages in the import directory into the cache. And
I am way too tired to write this right now.
